# jmLightToolkit
jmLightToolkit is a free toolkit in python I have written for managing lighting in Maya for my personal projects. Feel free to use it in your own projects or in production.
*(Optimized for MtoA)*

## Installation

1. Download and unzip the *jmLightToolkit.zip* file from [github](https://github.com/JsnMertens/jmLightToolkit/archive/master.zip)

2. Place this folder where you want on your computer or server but you need to specify to **MAYA_MODULE_PATH ** environment variable where is located this folder to allow maya to find it.
So for example you extract  under **c:\jmLightToolkit-master**.
To get it recognize by maya you need to add the following line in the maya.env file : **MAYA_MODULE_PATH = C:\jmLightToolkit-master**  

3. Drag and drop the "install.py" file onto the Maya viewport.

Note: **Maya.env** file is located to *C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\maya\20##\Maya.env*
